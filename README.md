# Searx Meta Search Engine with Docker Compose

This repository contains the configuration files needed to deploy the Searx meta search engine using Docker Compose. Searx is a privacy-respecting, customizable metasearch engine that aggregates results from various search engines without tracking users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/searx-docker.git
cd searx-docker
'''
###2. Customize Configuration (Optional)

The docker-compose.yaml file is pre-configured to run Searx with sensible defaults. However, you can customize the settings according to your needs. For example, you can modify the SEARXNG_BASE_URL environment variable to reflect your domain.
